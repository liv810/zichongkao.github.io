I think that one of the most valuable and underestimated benefits of working in tech in the Bay Area is learning its ethos.

The first pillar of this ethos is the belief that ability drives success. It is defining of the Bay Area because this belief is more pronounced here than any other place I know.

Over the past few months, not only have I stayed in the Valley, I have also left it. I've gone back to Singapore where I grew up, I've visited college friends in Chicago and Hongkong.

Singapore is known as a bastion of meritocracy. But my sense is that meritocracy in Singapore is mostly a means to achieve fairness - a tool for defensibility rather than an ideal. On occasion, meritocracy diverges from fairness and we can glimpse which is the means and which the ends. In the public sector, the entry-level payscale is banded by university results rather than job performance - not what you'd expect if you actually care about hiring and encouraging the best.

When I was in Chicago and Hongkong, I spoke with friends working in prominent banks and consulting firms and it doesn't seem like ability determines success there either. Incompetent people are hired because their parents are influential members of industry, employees . There is no moral judgement here. This hiring strategy makes sense. Any bank would happily pay a 120k analyst salary to increase their chances of getting in on that 500m dollar IPO, even if it were only by 1%.

But in tech, business doesn't rest in the hands of one or two people. It's democratized over thousands of companies or millions of users. You want the engineer who will design a better algorithm so ten million users will click on 1% more of your ads. And the engineer who can't do that - you wouldn't hire him even if he were Zuckerberg's son.



The second pillar is the belief we -you, me, the individual- can change the world. This is a huge cliche. I like to think of it as code for: The individual can make an outsized impact - one that extends beyond the people, places or practices you know of.

People spend around here spend a lot of time talking about whether Silicon Valley is the right place to be. These discussions tend to focus on the tangible aspects of the equation. But I think that the most significant benefit of being here is learning the ethos of Silicon Valley.

All places have their own ethos. These are beliefs that define the place, beliefs that have attained critical mass and now sustain themselves: They sway decisions, drive conversations - basically pop up with enough regularity that the outsider internalizes and perpetuates them, thereby becoming an insider.

Two beliefs stand out to me. The first is the belief that ability drives success. You might ask: What's so special about this? Many people around the world, not just in Silicon Valley, believe it. But I don't think that's actually true. In many places, your race, your religion or how much money you have determines success. In other places, meritocracy is propaganda, not ethos. There is a difference between wanting your people to believe in something and them actually believing in it.

Take Singapore for instance. Singapore is celebrated as a bastion of meritocracy. But meritocracy in Singapore is mostly a means to achieve fairness - a tool for political defensibility rather than an ideal. Admittedly, it is difficult to separate the two: fairness is often a side effect of a meritocracy. But between the cracks, we see which is the means and which the ends: The pressure to perform in school arises because many gates in Singapore are controlled by educational status not what you can do. In the workplace, seniority is important, . People say they believe that if you're good you'll be successful. But what they really believe is: If you're good - and graduated from university, and did your years at the company, and followed the rules - you'll be successful.

So how do we know that people in the Bay Area believe that ability drives success? There's probably no better way than to come here and see for yourself. But I think that the nature of the tech industry also provides a reason for this.

Most tech companies derive their value from masses of people or businesses. Apple relies on millions of people to buy their iPhones. Google relies on billions of people to click on their ads. In contrast, in other industries like consulting and investment banking, entire dealflows rest in the hands of a few individuals. Given such concentration of power, it makes sense that other qualities are prioritized over job performance.

Imagine we're running an investment bank and some company is looking to raise 500m in an IPO. Hiring the son of the CEO might cost us 240k (120k a year * 2 year analyst stint), but even if his presence only increases our chances of getting in on that IPO by 1%, we'd still get positive expected value. (500m raised * 7% fees * 1% = 350k > 240k)

In tech it's rare that a single deal counts for so much. Business is democratized over millions of users spanning multiple countries and cultures. The best way to reach these users is to build large systems. This is precisely what a software engineer is supposed to do and what tech companies hire for.



The second pillar is the belief we -you, me, the individual- can change the world. This is a huge cliche. I like to think of it as code for: The individual can make an outsized impact - one that extends beyond the people, places or practices you know of.
So in a sense, it is a very privileged conversation to have because not everyone is fortunate enough to be able to move anywhere for work. But we must not discount them on this basis. They are very valuable because the outsider is often best positioned to observe the pecularities of a place.

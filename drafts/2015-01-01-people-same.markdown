People tend to see themselves as special and others as different. The first happens when they do well, and the second when the other person does badly. Common to both is the notion that there exists a part of a person's identity that is quintessentially them, that is distinct from their experiences and associations, that can be held responsible for outcomes.

For many people, the size of this individual identity fluctuates depending on circumstances. In difficult times, it shrinks away leaving the parts of their identity which they inherit from elsewhere to take the hits: "I smoke because all my friends smoke." In good times, it enlarges to take credit: "I aced the test because I'm smart." These fluctuations make individual identity seem dynamic and important, giving us the perception that our thoughts and actions, and those of the people around us, are determined by it.

I believe that individual identity counts for a lot less than people think. There have been a number of situations where I have looked negatively upon someone else's actions, only to be in that same situation later and find myself drawn to the same course of action. And most tellingly, what looked like a character flaw for the other person, often started to seem more like just a tough situation in my case.

To be intellectually honest then, is to realize that people aren't so different. People behave differently not so much because they have different quintessential qualities, but because they are in different circumstances.

As such, understanding a person becomes mostly a matter of understanding their circumstances. Being able to place a person within a trope based on which school they attended, what their parents do, or in which city they grew up, explains more variation in their behavior than even self-declared explanations.

But more than helping us understand people, realizing that people aren't so different is good because it encourages empathy. Dismissing people because we think they are different is a blackhole from which we cannot recover. Instead, when we realize that their actions are mostly a result of their circumstances, we are encouraged to understand their circumstances and associations. Through repetition, we learn the distinctive traits of groups, even groups that we don't belong to, and this expands our understanding of other people in the group.

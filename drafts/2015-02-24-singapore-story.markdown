"There was a strong sense of solidarity among the Malays, which I was to learn grew from a feeling of being threatened, a fear of being overwhelmed by the more energetic and ahrdworking Chinese and Indian immigrants." pp41 - so herein lies the roots of racial politics in singapore? Why didn't just work harder when threatened?

"Malayism - a deep and intense pro-Malay, anti-immigrant sentiment" pp42

Japan in WWII brought the end of Britain's colonial dominance. pp53

"The three and a half years of Japanese occupation were the most important of my life. They gave me vivid insights into the behavior of human beings and human societties, their motivations and impulses. MY appreciation of governments, my understanding of power as teh vehicle for revolutioary change, would not have been gained without this expereince." pp 74.

Singapore strict punishment a result of effectiveness of JApanes rule? "The Japanese Military Administration governed by speading fear. It put up no pretence of civilised behavior. Punishmnet was so severe that crime was very rare.... As a result I have never believed those who advocate a soft approach to crime and punishment, claiming that punishment does not reduce crime. That was not my experience in Singapore before the war, during teh Japanese occupation or subsequently" pp 74

Culture has real world implciatios. CAn maek entire societies more or less malleable. Koreans vs Malayans pp78
"In Korea, the Japanese met resistnce from the moment they attempted to govern the country. They tried to suppress teh instincts and habits of a people of an old culture, people with a strong sense of pride in their history and a determination to oppose their new barbaric oppressors. They killed many Koreans but never broke their spirit. .. Had the Japanese stayed on in Singapore and Malaya, they would, within 50 years, have forged a coterie of loyal supporters as they had successfully done in Taian. Malaya was too young, its peopleso too diverse and its society too plastic and malleable to resist."


"Moreover, I wanted someone my equal, not someone who was not really grown up and needed looking after, and I Was not likely to find another girl who was my equal and who shared my interests."

Cecil Woong was LKY's roommate in Cambridge.

Laski was LKY's introduction to socialism: "I was immediately attracted to ti. It struck me as manifestly fair and everybody in this world should be given an equal chance in life, tht in a just and wellrdered socity there should not be a great disparity of wealth between persons betcause of their position or stauts, or that of their parents." pp105

LKY's gripe with communism only in their methods? Seems insufficient given how much he opposed them: "I agreed with the Marxists that .... My adversion to the communists sprang from their Leninist methods, not their Marxist ideals." pp105

"It ws only after I had been in office for some years that I recognised that performance varied substantially between the different races in Singapore, and among different categories within the same race. AFter trying out a number of ways to reduce inequalities and failing, I was gradually forced to conclude that the decisive factors were the people, their natural abiltiies, education and training."


Singapore's free healthcare: "Attlle government ... National Health Service Act... At teh counter the optician proudly told me that I did not have to pay for them, and instead gave me a form to sign. I was delighted and thought to myself that this was what a civilized society should be. pp129

LKY understands the value of the pes. Suggests why Singapore's press is so tightly controlled? pp150

Contrast dmeands now from before WWII. difference between between standing up and not just belief ? pp153

TCHS riots in response to national service act pp 168


Communists served as a crucial counter point for LKY's efforts: "It was the disagreeable alternative the communists posed that made constitutional methods of gentle erosion of colonial authority effective for the nationalists and accpetable to the colonialists." pp211

"Merdeka" independence in Malay pp225

Singapore: " Mushroom, all head,thin body, no roots" pp228

Were asians called asiatics pre- 1953? "I was told that sometime in 1953 the British press had started to use "Asian" because "Asiatic" had a touch of condesension or disrespect, and the changewas a concession to the people of India, Pakistan and Ceylon, now independent. I did no understand how this improved their status."

PAP's chief difficulty was to defeat communists without seeming like it doing it for the west. pp 250

"Marshall had taught me how not to be soft and weak when dealing with the communists. LIm Yew Hock taught me how not to be tough and flat-footed." pp 251

This  was the nub of hte problem - the frustratrion of the able and talented among the Chinese-educated who had no outlets for their energy and idealism..  pp254

"When the revolution did not delive utopia and the economy reerted to the free market, cadres, with the power to issue licences or with accesss to goods and services at official prices, were the first to be corrupt and exploit the masses'. Greed and self-interest as a conserved quantity pp255

non-negotiable provision to bar all persons known to have indulged in or been charged with subervsive activitiesfrom running as candidates in teh first election. pp257

Marshall sets up workers party after botched attempt to challenge LKY to a fight in Tanjong Pagar. pp 269

"I convinced him that it would be unwise to let voting remain voluntary, for the communists were better organised and better able to mobilise their followers, .." pp279

"I proposed that PAP elections to the central executive committee be modelled on the system for electing the Pope." pp 287

So weird to read about PAP complaining about "flagrant bias" in the Straits Times pp 298.

"all dressed in white to symbolise clean government - there would be none of the corruption that had been rife in teh past in Singaproe and existed in many other new countries (308)

"never been able to get the Enflish-educated to understand that deep social, economic, and political grevances were driving the Chinese-educated to support the communists and to help them overthrow the existing order. " (309)

On the importance of airconditioning : "To gie of their best, the ministers had to have air-conditioned offices. That may sound odd, but without air-conditioning, efficient work in tropicl Singapore would not have been feasible." (316)

Identifies problem: "Only then would we be able to tackle the lack of a Malayan consciousness among the Chinese, and imbue them wit ha commitment and loyalty to the country of their adoption; and this was all-important for they had to change their attitude before the Malay leaders in Kuala Lumpur would agree to merger" (319)

Women: "we shared the view that one reason for the backwardness of China and the rest of Asia, except Japan, was that women had not been emancipated. They had to be put on a part wit hteh men, given the same education adn enabled to make their full contribution to society." (325)

Flag: "Chinese wanted red for good fortune, the Malays red and white , their tradtional colours for courage and purity. But Indonesia alrady had red and white for their flag, and so had Poland. The Chinese, influenced by the five yellow starts on teh flag of Communist China, wanted stars. The Malays wanted a crecent moon... " (343)

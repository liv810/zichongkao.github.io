Notes on Graham's *The Intelligent Investor*


First pick industries: "the art of successful investment lies first in the choice of those industries that are most likely to grow in the future .. " (6)
- Not as easy as it looks in retrospect. Remember the airline industry. Physical growth does not translate into profits.

One of our chief requirements here that out readers limit themselves to issues selling not far above their tangible-asset value. (9)

## Chapter 1: Investment versus Speculation

What is an investment operation? "one which, upon thorough analysis promises safety of principle and an adequate return." (18)

But practically speaking, "the investor must recognize the existence of a speculative facto in his common-stock holdings. It is his taks to keep this component within minor limits, and ot be prepared financially and psychologically for adverse results that may be of short or long duration. (20)

You can speculate intelligently. Here are three ways you can speculate unintellgiently: "(1) Speculating when you think you are investing; (2) speculating seriously instead of as a pastime, when you lack proper knowledge and skill for it; and (3) risking more money in speculation than you can afford to lose." (21)

Use of trust funds and dollar-cost averaging for the defensive investor. (29)

Two obstacles for investors - human fallibility and competition. "He may be wrong in his estimate ofthe future; or even if he is right,the current market price may already fully reflect what he is anticipating." (31)
Solution: "The investor must follow policies which are (1) inherently sound and promising, and (2) not popular on Wall Street." (31)

## Chapter 2: The Investor and Inflation

Bonds traditionally seen as a poor counter to inflation because it returns a fixed dollar income (47). Graham argues that there is always a place for bonds though: "Our readers must have enoug intelligence to recognize that even high-quality stocks cannot be a bette purchase than bonds *under all conditions*" (48).

Graham claims that there is no reason to believe that common stock are likely to do better than bonds in the future even though they have done so in the past. (51) He further explains that there is "no close time connection between inflationary (or deflationary) conditions and the movement of common-stock earnings and prices." (51)

Earnings rate on capital by american businesses have not tracked cost of living. So stock prices cannot track inflation. (51) [I find this quite suspect. Inflation comes from more money chasing the same number of goods. But these goods are sold by busineses. At some point, in the chain, some business has's earnings have to soak up the increased prices]

  <h1>About Kao</h1>
  <p> 
    I'm a recent UChicago graduate, <img src="/pics/profile.png" style="float:right; margin-left: 2em; border: solid 1px #000;" alt="photo of kao">data scientist, passionate sailor and Singaporean. You can find me online on <a href="mailto:zichongkao+web@gmail.com">Gmail</a>, <a href="http://www.quora.com/Kao-ZC">Quora</a>, <a href="http://www.facebook.com/kaozichong">Facebook</a>, <a href="http://github.com/zichongkao/">Github</a> and <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/zi-chong-kao/55/b11/871/">LinkedIn</a>.
  </p>
  <h2>Undergrad</h2>
  <p>
    For me, the University of Chicago was an incredible buffet of knowledge, and I enjoyed sampling the offerings. Physics and philosophy were my initial interests, and later came math, economics, statistics, and CS. Some of the highlights were Marx's theory of Capitalism, point set topology and statistical machine learning.

  <h2>Data Scientist</h2>
  <p>
     I'm interested in using data to understand human behavior. Although humans possess a strong ability to empathize and intuit, algorithms supplied with sufficient data often outperform us at modelling the behavior of our own species. This fascinates me deeply. I will be headed to the Bay Area to join <a href="http://www.quora.com">Quora</a> as a data scientist.

  <h2>Sailor</h2>
  <p>
    I grew up sailing and enjoy racing immensely. Over the past few years, I ran the <a href="http://sailclub.uchicago.edu">UChicago Sailing Club</a>. We race 420s in the <a href="http://www.mcsasail.org">Midwest college racing circuit</a>. I've also been doing some keelboat racing: I skippered a J80 at the <a href="http://www.ccedhec.com/">EDHEC Sailing Cup</a> (below), and was bowman on the St. Francis during the ill-fated <a href="/sailing/2011/12/01/deadly_storm.html">2011 Chicago Mackinac Race</a>.

  <p>
    But racing <a href="http://laser.org">Lasers</a> is my true calling, and I hope to get back to it soon. I'm also currently seeking a position on the 2015 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transpacific_Yacht_Race">Transpac</a>. Taking part would be a dream come true. More about my experiences on my <a href="/sailing.html">sailing page.</a>

  <h2>Singaporean</h2>
  <p>
    I was born and raised in Singapore. I spent 2 years in the Singapore Army as a platoon commander of a tank unit. Here's me checking out the Aussie Abrams during a training exercise:

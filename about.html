  <h1>About Kao</h1>
  <p> 
    I'm a UChicago undergrad, <img src="/pics/profile.png" style="float:right; margin-left: 1em; border: solid 1px #000;" alt="photo of kao">future data scientist, passionate sailor and Singaporean. You can find me online on <a href="mailto:zichongkao+web@gmail.com">Gmail</a>, <a href="http://www.quora.com/Kao-ZC">Quora</a>, <a href="http://www.facebook.com/kaozichong">Facebook</a>, <a href="http://github.com/zichongkao/">Github</a> and <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/zi-chong-kao/55/b11/871/">LinkedIn</a>.
  </p>
  <h2>Undergrad</h2>
  <p>
    I am about to graduate from the University of Chicago. College has been a buffet of knowledge, and I've had an incredible time dabbling in math, statistics, CS and economics. Some of the highlights were Marx's theory of Capitalism, statistical machine learning and Appalachian murder ballads.

  <h2>Data Scientist</h2>
  <p>
     I'm interested in using data to understand human behavior. Although humans possess a strong ability to empathize, algorithms supplied with sufficient data often outperform us at modelling the behavior of our own species. This fascinates me deeply. After I graduate, I'll be headed to the Bay Area to join <a href="http://www.quora.com">Quora</a> as a data scientist.

  <h2>Sailor</h2>
  <p>
    I grew up sailing and enjoy racing immensely. For the past few years, I have been running the <a href="http://sailclub.uchicago.edu">UChicago Sailing Club</a>. We race 420s in the <a href="http://www.mcsasail.org">Midwest college racing circuit</a>. I've also been doing some keelboat racing: I skippered a J80 at the <a href="http://www.ccedhec.com/">EDHEC Sailing Cup</a> (below), and was bowman on the St. Francis during the ill-fated 2011 Chicago Mackinac Race.

  <p>
    But racing <a href="http://laser.org">Lasers</a> is my true calling, and I hope to get back to it soon. I'm also currently seeking a position on the 2015 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transpacific_Yacht_Race">Transpac</a>. Taking part would be a dream come true.

  <h2>Singaporean</h2>
  <p>
    I was born and raised in Singapore. I spent 2 years in the Singapore Army as a platoon commander of a tank unit. Here's me checking out the Aussie Abrams during a training exercise:

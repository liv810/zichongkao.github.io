  <h1>Sailing FAQ</h1>
    <h2>How did you get into sailing?</h2>
      <p>

        I learned to sail on blue wooden Optimists on the Straits of Johor - the waterway separating Singapore from Malaysia. I was 10 and my best friend's parents had invited me to join him on the "Get Kids Afloat" course at <a href="http://www.safyc.org.sg/">SAFYC</a>. That was enough to get me hooked on the special mix of fear, exhilaration and solitude that sailing so reliably dishes out. We signed up for the regular weekly training sessions, and ended up racing the Optimist until we outgrew it 3 years later.

    <h2>What do you like about sailing?</h2>  
     <p>
        Sailing's like a conversation with the elements. As the wind hits, you feel the hull lift beneath you. You respond by hiking out, pressing the boat down with your weight. Waves strike. You're thrown back and forth. You answer by torquing your upper body, lifting the bow over the crests. Today, most of our existence takes place in our minds. Our bodies seem little more than physical encumbrances. Sailing connects my body and mind again.

        Sailing also takes me away from regular life both physically and mentally. This allows me to take stock of my life, and think wonderful thoughts that would have never arisen on land.

    <h2>Hopes and dreams?</h2>
      <p>
        It seems the older I get, the worse of a sailor I become: Most of the serious racing I've done was as a kid. Back then, we went out for 6 hours a day, every Saturday and Sunday, for 40 weeks a year. I'd like to buck the trend and begin training and racing seriously again. Hopefully, in the Laser class - a boat which I know well and love.

        Growing up, reading about the Transpac, Fastnet and Sydney Hobart races captured my imagination. I'd like to compete in all the major long distance yacht races.

      <h2>Exoplanet and Binary Star Classification</h2>
      With a dataset consisting light curves of 166,904 stars, Sen Tian and I developed a method to differentiate between exoplanet transitions and eclipsing/occluding binary stars based on the <a href="http://iopscience.iop.org/2041-8205/713/2/L87/pdf/2041-8205_713_2_L87.pdf">Kepler data processing pipeline</a>. 
      <br><br>We used kernel regression to remove natural flux variation, and then analyzed periodicity and trough geometry to separate the exoplanet transition profiles from binary star profiles.<br>

      <h2>Chicago Crime Prediction</h2>
      Working with 13 years of public <a href="https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Crimes-2001-to-present/ijzp-q8t2">Chicago crime data</a>, we modelled occurrences of 10 classes of crimes as Poisson processes. Interestingly, we found that kernel smoothing over adjacent geographical regions, preceding weeks, and seasonal periods over previous years did not improve the model significantly. We theorize that this may be due to the sharp socio-economic divisions between Chicago neighborhoods, and small scale of temporal variations in crime rates.

      <h2>Viterbi Algorithm Implemented on Bahasa Melayu</h2>
      I compiled a list of 89,000 words by scraping 170 classical Malay texts in the <a href="mcp.anu.edu.au">Malay Concordance Project</a> corpus. After constructing a hidden markov model, I then implemented the Viterbi algorithm to determine if the vowel-consonant states that seem to underlie the English language are also found in Bahasa Melayu.

      I think that learning version control without understanding what's going on under the hood is not just tedious, but dangerous. PeepCode covers the internals succinctly, and with useful diagrams.

      If I've sent you here because you want to learn R quickly, this is what you're looking for. I think it introduces the right concepts in the right order.

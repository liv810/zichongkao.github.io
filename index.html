  <h1>About</h1>
  <p>I am a data scientist working at <a href='https://www.quora.com/profile/Kao-Zi-Chong'>Quora</a> in the San Francisco Bay Area.</p>
  <p>My formative years were spent in Singapore, at The Chinese High School and Delta Wing, Officer Cadet School; and then later at The University of Chicago.</p>
  <p>The outdoors are a big part of my life. I climb mountains and sail boats. </p>
  <h1>Kaomorphism</h1>
  <p>In math, a morphism is a transformation that preserves the structure of a space. Likewise, a kaomorphism applies Kao's worldview while, at least in theory, preserving the fundamental truths of the world. A kaomorphism could also refer to the Kao - Eric Morphis friendship.</p>

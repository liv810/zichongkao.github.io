<div id="home">
  <h1>Drafts</h1>
When this page was titled "Writing", it sat empty because my drafts never did feel complete. To remedy the situation, I have re-christened this the drafts page. I make no promises for the finality of any work here.
  <ul class="posts">
    {% for post in site.posts %}
      <li><span>{{ post.date | date_to_string }}</span> &raquo; <a href="{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a></li>
    {% endfor %}
  </ul>
</div>

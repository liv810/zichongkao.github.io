I recently had a discussion with a friend regarding an article about a woman who was dating her father. More than the unusual topic at hand, what struck me most was how moral revulsion causes us to cast others as different.

This disassociation allows us to become dogmatic: "Incest, even between consenting adults, even if they don't intend to have children, is just wrong." It allows us to assume the worst of them, to question things we wouldn't normally question in people like you and I: "Does she have mental issues? Are you sure he isn't taking advantage of her?"

All this is understandable. It is difficult to entertain the thought that these people in incestuous relationships, who have sex with animals and children aren't so different from us. It feels wrong. Society thinks it's wrong. It is against the law of nature. No, we are not like these people; if they even are people.

Reading pieces like these reminds me of their humanity. These people feel the same feelings, have the same pedestrian concerns as us. You'll see that the girl in the article is intelligent, self-aware and articulate. The one thing that sets her apart is that the man she fell in love with happened to be her father.

That this impulse didn't strike you or me is good fortune - we don't get to choose who we are attracted to. But if the impulse did strike, it would be difficult to pick the greater wrong: Going against a belief almost universally held in society but which I see no convincing justification for, or denying yourself one of the most magical feelings in life, one of the few things that, alone, can make a life worth living.

There is definitely a reason why society holds the belief that incest is wrong. But, many of the beliefs the society has held have been wrong. People once believed that the earth is flat, that it is acceptable for a man to own another. Many people also underestimate the number of beliefs we presently hold that have no other basis than precedent. Perhaps one English king wanted to turn the people away from his rival and decided to call his incestuous relationship immoral. My point is that, we must challenge society to produce reasons for its beliefs. All of them, all the time.

The other thing I think is important is that you and I, the normal people, must do the challenging, must ironically be the ones to contest normalcy. Suppose the girl were to argue that her incestuous relationship is acceptable, society wouldn't take her seriously. After all, she has a vested interest in the situation and cannot be trusted to be objective or prioritize the interests of the rest. So if this convention were to be baseless, we are the only people able to correct it.

The individual in society is thus responsible for fighting the tendency to set others apart. Incestuous couples, pedophiles, sociopaths - the more deviant they seem, the harder we must try. Only the recognition of our similarities will enable us to use empathy, the most human of all capacities, enough base from which to analyze differences and objectively decide if these are beliefs we want to embrace or exile. 

And lest someone suggest that it be better to exile when in doubt, we should also remember that as much as we are mostly the same, all of us have beliefs that, in a different place, in a different age, we could be exiled for.

Over the years, I've made several half-hearted attempts to write publicly. But there has always been the nagging concern that some years down the line, when I least expect it, the writings of my youth will be dredged up and used against me.

I now believe this belief is illogical. The problem is that it is predicated on becoming successful enough that my earlier writings will be of public interest. However, it doesn't take into account the improbability of this success. I feel reasonably confident that most people I know will never achieve it; and thinking I will fare better than these people who I grew up with, who received the same education and opportunities I did, seems like hubris.

With this in mind, we can reconsider the value-proposition of writing publicly. The expected value of the upside is clear. The benefits of writing publicly are well-known, and we don't have to apply a probability multiplier because they are mostly captured by the very act of writing and are thus basically a certainty. But to other side of the equation, the side measuring the expected damage from writing publicly, we now apply our vanishingly small multiplier. If writing publicly was once a marginal activity, it now becomes wholly productive.

There is also an interesting relationship that affects the magnitude of the equation, but not the net value. In essence, without the benefits from writing publicly, the probability of achieving success decreases. This means that the left and right side of the equation move together: Write publicly, increase your chances of success and accept that you become more susceptible to damage, or risk nothing and accept lower chances of success.

The point is, worrying that writing publicly will hurt you doesn't make sense for most people because it is improbable that we will amount to anything worth hurting. It is also self-defeating because not writing makes this improbability more improbable.

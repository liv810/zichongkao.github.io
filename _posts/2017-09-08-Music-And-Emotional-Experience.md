I have a theory that music is special because it gives rise to moments when one can experience the emotions of another. We find these moments in the clipping of a word, the changing color in a voice, or a pianist's slowing rubato. And as listeners, we go: "Ah, I know how that feels like right there."

No other mode of communication seems to allow for this; and I can only speculate why music has this ability. It could be that music has infinite variations in pitch, timing, timbre, etc, and so it is unconstrained by signifiers like words or symbols that require shared knowledge of their meanings. Indeed the complexity is mind-boggling enough that musicians often avoid actively focussing on any one mechanic for fear of coming across stilted or sacrifising other elements outside of the focus.

It could also be that music is non-directed, in that it's point isn't that the listener receives, but that the performer expresses. This removes distortions from self-awareness or awareness of the communication.

These elements paint a picture of a musician in their prime: Conscious not of the audience, or the specific mechanics of the piece, but the fullest expression of themselves. So that when they modulate the sounds they make in any one of the infinite possibilities, we the listeners can replay in ourselves the precise stirrings that would have led to that gloomy lilt or soaring harmony.

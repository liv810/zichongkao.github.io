As luck would have it, Coastwalk was organizing a backpack down the northern coast of California in the week before the start of my internship. I was doubly excited about the trip when I found out that Coastwalk is a non-profit that runs these trips to increase awareness of environmental and public-access issues. They did an extremely good job organizing the backpack and I heartily recommend them.

Day 1 (6/17/13)
===============
Stan, our guide, was kind enough to give me a lift up from the Larkspur Ferry Terminal to Ukiah where we met the rest of the group at 1pm. We drove through dry, crusty hills and and cool Redwood forests before we reaching Petrolia, a sleepy town near the mouth of the Mattole river. At 5pm, we picked up a delicious dinner generously made by the owner of the Petrolia general store before moving on to our campground.

After dinner, the tide was low, and I was able to hike north across the mouth of the Mattole river. There, I found myself face to face with a skunk. It lifted its tail and stood very still for a while before scurried away and hiding under a pile of rocks. Feeling disappointed, I decided to scrambling up the side of the cliff to enjoy the sunset.

Taken from an outcrop 10 minutes north of Mattole campground. Campsite barely visible on the left.

That night, the others shared stories about ticks and bears and mountain lions and rattlesnakes. Having come from Chicago only 2 days ago, I felt like I had teleported into a different world was rich with wildlife and incredibly peaceful and beautiful.

Day 2
=====
We left Mattole campground earlier than intended (08:30) and made Punta Gorda lighthouse at noon. We had walked slowly, and had stopped frequently to examine starfishes in the rock pools, cheeky otters that popped their heads up every now and then to spy on us, and lazy sea lions that were sunbathing on the rocks.

After a leisurely lunch, we left around 12:45 and reached Kooskie Creek campground at 14:30. I read my book, snoozed, and made dinner of onions, mushrooms, pasta in marina sauce. Then, I went up to the ridge to eat and watch the waves. My diary says that I felt: “Profound calm and joy.”

Day 3
=====
Kooskie Creek to Big (Hadley) Creek.It was about 6.5 miles. In fact, almost every day was about 6.5 miles. Left at 9:00, lunch at 12:45, arrived at 14:30. At 10:30, we had a bit of excitement crossing a rocky outcrop. Even though the tide was low, the sea came all the way up to the rocks.  We had to time our run well to avoid getting wet.

At Big Creek, Stan brought us to a very pretty campsite tucked away 20 minutes up the valley. The view was incredible. It got a bit chilly. I finished my book and was, thankfully, rescued by Chuck’s spare. I had the same pasta for dinner again. The rest were very impressed that I had fresh food. In fact, I didn’t have much time in San Francisco and couldn’t be bothered to hunt down some light camping food for the backpack.

Day 4
=====
Warm day. <img src="/pics/gitchell1.jpg" width="40%" style="float:right; margin-left: 1em; border: solid 1px #000;">
Covered 7.5 miles. Reached Gitchell Creek past 3. There was a wonderful secret garden in the canyon. I saw a slug that looked like a bright green lump of poop. Later found out it was a Banana Slug. I spent a blissful half hour exploring the canyon. It was fun following the creek up, hopping from rock to rock and discovering lush, shadowy forest with each bend. My favorite part of the backpack.

Day 5 (6/21/13)
===============
<img src="/pics/fishnchips.jpg" width="40%" style="float:right; margin-left: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em; border: solid 1px #000;">
Short hike to Shelter Cove, a small resort town. Had a bath and some excellent fish and chips from the general store.

I was supposed to leave that night, to get back to SF in time for work on Monday. The rest of the group was going to carry on for another 4 days into the Sinkyone region. But because the Greyhound departed Garberville only the next morning, Les and I decided to stay the night with group at the Nadelos campground. Best thing was that I got to partake in gourmet dinner with the group!

The Greyhound ride cost a bomb ($66) but I made it back to SF the next day. Here’s a map of the area we covered. Click on image to enlarge.

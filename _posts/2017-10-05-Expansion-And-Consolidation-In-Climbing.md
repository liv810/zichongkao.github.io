title: "Expansion and Consolidation in Climbing"
---

It is useful to think of training on a spectrum from *expansion* to *consolidation*. Expansion is attempting something far harder than previous accomplished. Consolidation is mastering something that can already be achieved.

New climbers tend to do all their training in the middle of the spectrum, investing their efforts on routes that are right on the precipice of completion. This optimizes for satisfaction - it is the most direct way to satisfy the allure of setting a new personal record. But improvement quickly plateaus because it doesn't effectively prepare the mind or body for sustained progress.

Better to direct efforts to both ends of the spectrum. Instead of attempt routes at the redpoint grade, say 11c, one at a time, consolidate by doing 11as three times in a row, or better still, till failure (unprepared falling; not taking). This allows for much more time in the omg-i'm-about-to-fall zone, which is where performance really matters for progressing to harder grades.

Another impediment to progress is grade intimidation. For someone struggling to climb 11c, climbing 12a isn't at all part of their identity. They feel like an imposter just grasping the starting holds. This prevents them from committing which, on a boundary-pushing route, means certain failure. The natural way to overcome this is to try something even harder. If 12a seems scary, try 12b and the 12a sits a lot more nicely in the mind when returning to it. Simply staying in the middle of the spectrum doesn't acclimatize the mind to the idea of climbing harder stuff.

Beyond the mental aspects of targetting expansion and consolidation, physically, they map very conveniently to endurance and power. This is basically just periodization, which in the world of sports science, seems generally accepted as the optimal way to train.

More generally, this, as with many other climbing lessons, abstracts well to other parts of life: The idea of expansion and consolidation should be a useful way to organize learning of any sort.

I've wanted to write publicly for a while now. But the biggest reason I have not has been the worry that many years down the line, when I am successful and famous, the writings of my youth will be dredged up and used against me. After all, you know what they say about the internet never forgetting.

I now think that this belief is flawed. The problem is that it is premised on becoming successful and famous enough that people will bother to hunt down my old writings. But if I am honest with myself, this probably isn't very likely. I have about 500 friends on facebook currently. Even if I indulge myself a bit and claim I'll be more successful than 90% of my social network, I don't believe that 50 years from now there'd be journalists trying to track down personal details of 50 of my friends.

With this in mind, the expectation values don't work out: The downside is the tiny probability that I will attain said level of success, multiplied by the harm that my old writings could cause. The upside is the assured benefits that writing publicly will give: Having readers might open doors and will incentivize me to write; And writing sharpens thoughts like no other activity.

I have a suspicion too that writing is a powerful driver of success. This raises interesting conundrum: Don't write publicly, have nothing to hide, but remain unsuccessful. Write publicly and achieving success, but be at the mercy of your work.

I think I'll take my chances.

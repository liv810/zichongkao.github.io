I want to start maintaining a collection of papers for people who have already had a first course in statistics but want to develop stronger intuition and experience with real-world applications:

 - <strong><a href="https://studies2.hec.fr/jahia/webdav/site/hec/shared/sites/czellarv/acces_anonyme/OringJASA_1989.pdf">Risk Analysis of the Space Shuttle: Pre-Challenger Prediction of Failure</a></strong>
 - <strong><a href="http://statweb.stanford.edu/~ckirby/brad/other/Article1977.pdf">Stein's Paradox in Statistics</a></strong> An extremely readable introduction to the Stein Paradox. We learn that when we have more than 3 gaussians, the best estimator of the their means is not the sample mean!
 - <strong><a href="https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/spring10/cos424/papers/FreedmanStark2003.pdf">What is the Chance of an Earthquake?</a></strong> This is non-mathematical paper whih discusses what probabilties mean. The topic is important for shaping the impact of our work on the general public. The paper proposes that "probability is just a property of a mathematical model intended to describe some features of the natural world. For the model to be useful, it must be shown to be in good correspondence with the system it describes."

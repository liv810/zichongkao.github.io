Every year, 300 boats race across Lake Michigan from Chicago to the idyllic island of Mackinac in one of the longest freshwater races in the world. In 2011, a massive storm hit the race killing two sailors. 

Off we go
=============
The race started in front of Chicago on a sunny Saturday morning under a gentle 5-knot breeze. We flew the bird and took off down the rhumb line. By nightfall, we were cruising under 15 knots of breeze.  In the distance, the twinkling lights of the other boats were fading away. Our bet to stick to the rhumb line rather than head north along the coast seemed to have paid off. The crew were mighty pleased. We started the watch system: 4 hours on, 4 hours off.

I came on at 2am and the wind had not let up. <a href="/pics/bird.jpg"><img src="/pics/bird.jpg" width="40%" style="float:right; margin-left: 1em; border: solid 1px #000;"></a>
It was eerie to be trimming the sails in total darkness and silence save the swish of water underfoot. It seemed like the race was going to be calm and easy. By 4am, time was beginning to slow. I was delighted when the sky started to brighten and I had the sunrise to watch. 

Over Sunday, the winds picked up still, building to about 20 knots. Huge white dunes on the opposite coast of Lake Michigan came into sight. We nosed downwind, doused the asym and put up our big blue .5 spinnaker also stamped with St Francis’s white dove. “Feed the bird! Feed the bird!” we chanted as we powered downwind with maximum sail area up. With the wind coming from the south, its fetch was the entire length of Lake Michigan, allowing for huge rolling swells to build. We spent an exhilarating afternoon surfing down these swells, competing who could drive the boat faster. When the boat speed hit 12 knots (theoretical max hull speed of the St Francis), cheers went up all around. The old hands were remarking that these were as perfect conditions as they’d ever seen.

Takedown on the High Seas
=========================
By evening, the wind had grown to 25 knots as we rounded Point Betsie and blazed into the Manitoulin Straits. Our big kite, rated for only 18 knots of wind, was dangerously taut and could only be trimmed on the winch. We were crashing up waves and romping down in a trail of white water. We were in the groove. Around 8 pm, reports predicted that a storm was heading in from the west and would reach us at midnight. Someone suggested putting up the asym to capitalize on the growing wind. The guys on the foredeck didn’t like the plan. The asym would take too long to take down and be too difficult to handle when the storm hit. We got Mike, the senior foredeck guy to appeal the decision. Thankfully, they reconsidered and decided we would take down the asym, put up the no.3, and reef the main. It was a complete about-face. Mike shrugged and said: “They aren’t thinking straight. They’re tired.”

By the time the decision was made, the gusts were up to 30 knots and, as bowman, it fell to me to spike the asym. I crept to the bow, and in the moonlight, looked back on the boat amidst rows of whitewater extending to the horizon. The crew took agonizingly long to bring the pole within reach. This gave me plenty of time to worry that the stainless steel grommet would explode out of the shackle and strike me in the face. Balanced on the top railing of the pulpit, the pole came into reach. As the boat pitched into the waves, the pole swung about leaving me flailing as I tried to insert the spike properly. I got it on my second attempt and it was a great relief to see the sail flutter off without smacking me.

Storm On!
=========
By about 11pm we had made all preparations and were basically waiting for the storm to hit. Even with the reduced sail area, we were making 7 knots just by surfing the waves. Lightning started to move in causing the sky to flicker like a broken TV. The hairs on my arms stood on end and the metal fixtures hissed. It felt like the air was bursting with energy.

The storm hit just after midnight. The first gust struck at 45 knots. Back in the cockpit, they tried to wrestle with the sails to give us some control. The 2 other foredeck guys and I were crouched on the forward deck, tethered to the rail. There wasn’t enough space in the cockpit since all hands (but Maria) were on deck. Then, the main gust roared through. Lying on the deck, I watched as the instruments read out the windspeed: 45.. 48 .. 52 .. 63. The sails were flapping violently, causing the mast to vibrate and the entire boat to tremble beneath us. The thunder overhead and the snapping of the fabric sounded like exploding bombs. I lay on the deck wondering why the sails hadn’t torn right off the mast. Then I thought that it would be better that the sails rip than bring the whole mast down on me. This convinced me to secretly unclip myself from the rail.

At some point, I stopped feeling scared. I had experienced this many times as a kid: Age 10 and being tossed about in a squall, there’d come a point where I’d accept that whatever would happen, would happen. I could only do so much to control my fate. And so, it'd seem absurd to have been so scared before.

The storm stretched on for what felt like 2 hours. In fact, it had only been 20 minutes. The wind quietened to about 40 knots, which after 60 knots gusts, felt calm and peaceful. The no.3 had been shredded, the battens smashed. The flapping had caused the sheets to be wound up into great hard knots that we had to cut. 

Finish
======
The rest of the race was a blur to me. Not long after, I felt very sick and threw up. I tried to help changing the sails, but was overcome by nausea again and was promptly ordered down below. I felt guilty about not helping out and promised myself that I’d take a quick rest and head back up. Even with the pitching of the boat, I fell asleep immediately on a pile of sailbags. This was at about 01:00.

I was semi-conscious at about 2.30am and still felt guilty for not being up on deck helping out. I could hear the guys up above gybing the boat again and again. But I felt so weak that I could barely sit up. So I lay there and fell asleep again. In my hazy state, I heard the radio announce that several other boats had gone missing and sailors were in the water. The crew on deck were asked to watch out for ships and sailors in the water. I knew that this was going to be futile. In the 2 meter high waves, driving rain and strobing lightning, we couldn’t make out anything more than 10 meters away.

At 04:00, I awoke feeling much better and put on some dry clothes and forced myself up on deck. Half the crew had gone down earlier to rest. The other half that had remained looked half-dead. A number of them had been up since sunrise the previous day. Owing to the storm, we hadn't eaten for 20 hours too. The winds had now dropped to a whisper, the sea flat as a mirror. The lack of speed gnawed at the crew’s morale. After the exertions of the night, sitting still and being quiet (as is important for good light wind sailing) was difficult. I was rested and took over sail trimming. 

We made Grey's Reef lighthouse at about 10am, and passed under the Mackinac Bridge at 11am. At 11:31 on Monday morning, we crossed the finish.

Post-race
=========
On reaching the dock, we learned that the yacht Wingnuts had capsized in the storm. Only 6 of its 8 crew had been rescued. The bodies of the skipper and one crew were discovered still tethered to the capsized boat. I immediately thought about my decision to un-tether myself, and later found out that another crew had done so too. 

I was mostly shocked that people had died on a race that I had participated in. Growing up, I had read about the tragic 1998 Sydney Hobart and 1979 Fastnet races. The deaths in those races had, until now, seemed to have occurred in a different world of tougher, braver sailors.
